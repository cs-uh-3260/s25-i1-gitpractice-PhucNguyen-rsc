This article is interesting because it shows the core of being a software engineer is solving problems using technology. It tells us what would be the day-to-day tasks of typical software engineer (from designing a whole new application to maintaining exisiting infrastructure).

Interesting article about SWE. This article highlights how the role of software engineers is shifting from manual coding to more strategic problem-solving, with a focus on collaboration and business context. It emphasizes that AI tools are enhancing engineers' work rather than replacing them, making soft skills increasingly important.
