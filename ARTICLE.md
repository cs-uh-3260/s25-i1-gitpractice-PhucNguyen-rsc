Interesting article about SWE. This article highlights how the role of software engineers is shifting from manual coding to more strategic problem-solving, with a focus on collaboration and business context. It emphasizes that AI tools are enhancing engineers' work rather than replacing them, making soft skills increasingly important.

I particularly appreciate how the article emphasizes the importance of continuous learning in the field. The mention of 
different engineering roles, such as front-end, back-end, and full-stack, provides clarity for individuals considering 
a career in software development.

Another highlight is the focus on adaptability and collaboration as key skills for success. In an industry that evolves 
rapidly, these skills are critical. The detailed explanation of educational requirements and certifications is also 
helpful for beginners mapping out their career path
